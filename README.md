# Ichip_ps1_ALU

I have uploaded the problem statement of this as Ichip_ps1.pdf

Here we are finding the values of zx,zy,nx,ny,f, no function bits based on input x and y, and also based on output we are finding the value of zr, nr.

Here in the repository, we have uploaded the design module of ALU Calc. v along with the test bench Calc_tb.v and submitted the output txt file as Calc.txt.

Here is the waveform of the design module on the basis of testbench
