# Ichip_ps1_ALU

Here we are finding the values of zx,zy,nx,ny,f,no function bits on the basis of input x and y and also on the basis of output we are finding the value of zr,nr.

Here in the repository we have upload the design module of ALU Calc.v along with the test bench Calc_tb.v and also have submitted the output txt file as Calc.txt.
